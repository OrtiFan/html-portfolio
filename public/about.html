<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! My name is Ryann Mack, and I've just started to learn how
  to code in Javascript and HTML. This website is a culmination
  of some of the mini projects I've done with Angela Yu on Udemy!
</p>

<p>
  I've coded before, in my senior year of high school! I took AP 
  Computer Science, and we used BlueJ to learn Java. It was very 
  difficult but extremely rewarding and fun! I love the idea of 
  using actions to solve puzzles in an entirely new language. I
  discovered that it was exactly the kind of challenge I would want
  to pursue as a career!
</p>

<p>
  I hope to make many more websites of my work, just like this one
  and see all of the progress I'll make!
